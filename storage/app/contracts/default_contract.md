In the event that Licensor proceeds with a third-party promotional offer with a third party not approved by Licensor, Licensor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon fourteen (14) days prior written notice to Licensee, without either party bearing liability to the other under this Section 5.2 except that Licensee shall pay Licensor an amount equal to the aggregate of the Monthly Minimum Fees for the lesser of six (6) months following such termination of the Agreement and the remainder of the Term. Licensee shall provide Licensor written notice at least fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of each Third-Party Promotional Offer.
