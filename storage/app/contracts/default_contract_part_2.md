Licensee shall use good faith efforts to classify each Included Program within one or more of the available genres/categories in an appropriate manner. Licensor shall have the right at any time to object to a classification of an Included Program that is, in the sole and good faith judgment of Licensor, derogatory or inappropriate, and to require Licensee to promptly reclassify such Included Program in the genres/categories designated by Licensor.

Licensor shall have the right to withdraw any Included Program from the Licensed Service (and as soon as practicable after written notice from Licensor, Licensee shall cease to make such program available on the Licensed Service and shall cease to promote such program’s availability on the Licensed Service) if (i) Licensor reasonably believes that it does not have, or no longer has, or there is actual or threatened litigation regarding, the rights necessary to authorize Licensee to distribute Included Programs as provided herein; (ii) Licensor reasonably believes that Licensee’s continued distribution of Included Programs will violate the terms of any of Licensor’s agreements with any applicable copyright owner, artist, composer, producer, director, publisher, distributor or similar third party rights holder; (iii) Licensor reasonably believes that Licensee’s continued distribution of Included Programs may adversely affect Licensor’s material relations with any applicable copyright owner, artist, composer, producer, director, publisher, distributor or similar third party rights holder; (iv) Licensor reasonably believes that such withdrawal is necessary in order to minimize the risk of legal liability; or

Withdrawal may, as specified by Licensor, apply to all features and functionalities licensed pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the withdrawn Included Program or only to certain portions of such features and functionalities with respect to the withdrawn Included Program. In the event of any withdrawal of an Included Program pursuant to this section before the last day of the License Period for such Included Program, Licensor shall promptly commence a good faith attempt to agree with Licensee as to a substitute program for exhibition pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Licensee shall have the right to exhibit such substitute program for the remainder of the License Period of the withdrawn Included Program and shall have such rights and obligations with respect to such substitute program as if such substitute program were an Included Program. Licensee’s payment obligations with respect to any withdrawn Included Program shall cease as of the date of withdrawal and shall resume only when a substitute program is made available on the Licensed Service in accordance with the terms and conditions herein; provided that Licensor may determine in its sole discretion whether the License Period of the substitute program shall end at the expiration of the License Period for the withdrawn Included Program or be extended for a length of time corresponding to the period between the withdrawal of the withdrawn Included Program and availability of the substitute program. Licensor acknowledges that its rights under this Article 6 of this Schedule are intended solely as a right to withdraw individual titles and is not intended as a means for more broadly terminating Licensee’s rights to distribute Included Programs hereunder.

**7. PAYMENT**.

7.1 As between the parties, Licensee shall be responsible for processing all transactions and the billing and collection of all monies due from Customers in connection with the exploitation of the Included Programs on the Licensed Service as permitted herein; provided that Licensee may retain third parties to perform the foregoing services. In the event that Licensee retains any such third party, Licensee shall (i) inform such third party of all related obligations, (ii) not authorize any person or entity to do any of the acts forbidden herein and (iii) remain solely liable for the performance of all obligations and responsible for all acts and omissions of such third parties. Licensee shall at all times be solely liable for the payment of the license fees due to Licensor hereunder.

7.2 Amounts which become due to Licensor hereunder (including, without limitation, any advances or guarantee payments) shall immediately be due and payable and shall immediately be non-recoupable, non- refundable and not subject to rebate, deduction or offset of any kind. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Licensor, if Licensee fails to pay any license fees or advances or guarantees when due and payable, interest shall accrue on any such overdue amount until such time as the overdue amount is paid in full, at a rate equal to the lesser of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the prime rate announced from time to time in the U.S. edition of the Wall Street Journal (the “Prime Rate”) or the permitted maximum legal rate.

7.3 The parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions of this Article 7 are of the essence. Licensee covenants and agrees to make all payments to Licensor hereunder in a timely manner.

Licensor will deliver each Copy with 1080p masters with Dolby 5.1 audio for all content for which such masters are available, and for any content not produced in 1080p, the highest quality video and audio available to Licensor. Licensor may provide, via metadata, e-commerce promotion, which will appear along with the Included Programs and Advertising Materials, to the extent required by third party obligations (such as guild or union rules). Licensor shall exercise reasonable efforts to deliver all Included Programs free of any: (a) advertising or promotional messaging, including any bumpers, end cards or other messages that promote the Included Programs or Advertising Materials, any other content, Licensor’s website, or any other online property (such as “call outs” to Licensors’ or third party websites) and (b) bugs, burn-ins, crawls, or other on-screen identifiers except to the extent included in the original exhibition (if any) of Included Programs. 

8.2 If Licensor has available out of stock on-hand a dubbed or subtitled version of an Included Program in the Licensed Language, Licensor shall, as part of the Servicing Fee for such Included Program, provide such materials to Licensee. If Licensor is unable to provide all materials for a dubbed or subtitled version of an Included Program licensed hereunder to Licensee out of available stock on hand, Licensor shall have the right to create such dubbed or subtitled version and provide copies of such materials, in each case at Licensee’s sole reasonable cost. If Licensor elects not to create such a version, Licensee may, only with the prior written consent of Licensor, and only in strict accordance with all third party contractual restrictions and Licensor’s technical specifications, prepare dubbed or subtitled versions of such Included Program in the Licensed Language, which versions shall be sufficient to cover Licensor’s worldwide usage of such dubbed or subtitled versions in all media throughout the universe, the costs (including, without limitation, any third party contractual obligations, residuals and other reuse fees) for which shall be the sole responsibility of Licensee; provided, however, that (i) immediately upon Licensee’s completion of the original dubbing or subtitling of an Included Program licensed hereunder, Licensee shall forward to Licensor a copy of such originally dubbed or subtitled version, and (ii) Licensee shall allow Licensor unrestricted access, at no charge to Licensor, to the masters of the dubbed and/or subtitled versions during such Included Program’s License Period. Following the conclusion of the License Period for any Included Program licensed hereunder or any other termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall deliver to Licensor the master and all copies of all dubbed and subtitled versions of such Included Program. In connection with the creation of any dubbed or subtitled version, Licensee shall be responsible for obtaining all necessary third party clearances such that any subsequent use of such materials by Licensor or its designee shall be free and clear of any residual or reuse fees. Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless the Licensor Indemnified Parties from and against any and all claims, actions, causes of action, damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) arising out of, in connection with or founded upon such dubbing or subtitling. All rights, including copyrights and trademarks, in such dubbed and subtitled versions of the Included Programs licensed hereunder, shall vest in Licensor upon creation thereof, subject only to the rights granted herein to Licensee hereunder during the Term hereof. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensee is not granted and is not acquiring any ownership rights in or of, or interest in, any Copy, Included Program or dubbed or subtitled version of an Included Program by reason of Licensee’s permitted use or manufacture thereof. Licensee will execute, acknowledge and deliver to Licensor any instruments of transfer, conveyance or assignment in or to any dubbed and subtitled versions necessary or desirable to evidence or effectuate Licensor’s ownership thereof and in the event that Licensee fails or refuses to execute, acknowledge or deliver any such instrument or documents then Licensor shall be deemed to be, and Licensee hereby nominates, constitutes and appoints Licensor its true and lawful attorney in fact irrevocably to execute and deliver all such instruments in Licensee’s name or otherwise, it being acknowledged that such power is a power coupled with an interest.

8.3 Within thirty (30) days following (a) the last day of the last License Period, Licensee shall at

Licensor’s request and election either return all Copies to Licensor or erase or degauss all such Copies and supply Licensor with a certification of erasure or degaussing of such Copies.

8.4 In the event  the Agreement is terminated for any reason, upon expiration of the Term, upon a

Suspension that has not been terminated pursuant to Section 9.4 of this Schedule, and, with respect to any Included Program, if such Included Program has been withdrawn pursuant to Article 6 of this Schedule, Licensee shall within thirty (30) days return, destroy, delete or disable, at Licensor’s request and election, all Copies and Advertising Materials in its possession and provide Licensor with a certificate of return or destruction (as applicable), signed by an authorized representative of Licensee.

8.5 Except as set forth in Section 8.6, Licensee shall be solely responsible to determine, collect, bear, remit, pay, and shall hold Licensor forever harmless from and against, any and all taxes (including interest and penalties on any such amounts, but excluding Licensor’s corporate income tax), payments or fees that Licensee is required to pay by any governmental taxing authority or otherwise under applicable law or contractually that are now or hereafter imposed, levied or claimed against Licensee based upon Licensee’s licensing, rental, importation, delivery, exhibition, possession, distribution or use hereunder to or by Licensee of the Included Programs or any print, Copy or Advertising Materials of or related to an Included Program, including, without limitation, where such taxes or surcharges are applicable national, regional or local sales, use, value-added, consumption, excise, gross receipts or other similar taxes (“Sales Taxes”). All prices mentioned in this Agreement are exclusive of and Licensee shall pay to Licensor any Sales Taxes that are owed by Licensee solely as a result of entering into this Agreement and which are required to be collected from Licensee by Licensor under applicable law. If applicable, Licensee may provide to Licensor a valid Sales Tax exemption certificate, in which case Licensor shall not collect the taxes covered by such certificate.   In each circumstance where Licensee is responsible under applicable Sales Tax laws in the Territory to account for any Sales Taxes due, Licensee shall be solely responsible for complying with such laws.

8.6 All prices and payments stated herein shall be exclusive of and made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any tax, duty or other charges, of whatever nature imposed by any taxing or governmental authority, unless such deduction or withholding is required by applicable law, in which case Licensee shall: (i) withhold the legally required amount from payment; (ii) remit such amount to the applicable taxing authority; and (iii) within thirty (30) days of payment, deliver to Licensor original documentation or a certified copy evidencing such payment (“Withholding Tax Receipt”). In the event Licensee does not provide a Withholding Tax Receipt in accordance with the preceding sentence, Licensee shall be liable to and shall reimburse Licensor on demand for the withholding taxes deducted from payments. Licensee shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate with Licensor to proceed with requisite procedures required to minimize such taxes to the extent permissible under applicable law. The parties agree that as of the Agreement Date, applicable law in the Territory does not require withholding on payments from Licensee to Licensor. If Licensee’s assignment causes an increased rate of tax withholding or deduction to apply to the payments to Licensor, then the gross amount payable by Licensee to Licensor shall be increased so that after such deduction or withholding, the net amount received by Licensor will not be less than Licensor would have received had Licensee not made the assignment.

8.7 Upon the loss, theft or destruction (other than as required hereunder) of any Copy of an Included Program, Licensee shall promptly furnish Licensor with proof of such a loss, theft or destruction by certification from an authorized person.

8.8 Each Copy of the Included Programs and all Advertising Materials are the property of Licensor, subject only to the limited right of use expressly authorized herein, and Licensee shall not authorize any lien, charge, pledge, mortgage or encumbrance to attach thereto.

8.9 Other than providing dubbed or subtitled versions pursuant to Section 8.2 of this Schedule, in no event shall Licensor be required to deliver or make available any Included Program in any language version other than the original language version.

**9. CONTENT PROTECTION & SECURITY.**

9.1 General. Licensee represents and warrants that it has put in place secure and effective, stringent and robust security systems and technologies to prevent theft, pirating, unauthorized exhibition (including, without limitation, unauthorized exhibition to non-Customers and exhibition outside the Territory), unauthorized copying or duplication of any video reproduction or compressed digitized copy of any Included Program and that such security systems, procedures and technologies are and shall be no less stringent or robust than those which Licensee employs with respect to films licensed from other licensors or than industry standard. Licensee shall maintain and upgrade such security systems, procedures and technologies (including, without limitation, encryption methods) as Licensor shall determine in its sole reasonable discretion is necessary to prevent theft, pirating, unauthorized exhibition (including, without limitation, exhibition to non-Customers and exhibition outside the Territory), and unauthorized copying or duplication of any video reproduction or compressed digitized copy of any Included Program.   Licensee shall comply with all reasonable instructions relating to the foregoing given by Licensor or Licensor’s representative. Licensee shall comply with Licensor’s specifications concerning the storage and management of its digital files and materials for the Included Programs at Licensee’s sole expense, and as such specifications may be updated at any time during the Term.   Licensee shall not authorize any use of any video reproduction or compressed digitized copy of any Included Program for any purpose other than as is expressly permitted herein. Licensor or its authorized representative shall have the right, upon reasonable advance written notice, to inspect and review Licensee’s security systems, procedures and technologies at Licensee’s places of business (including off-site facilities, if any) as Licensor deems necessary, provided such inspection is conducted during regular business hours and does not interfere materially with Licensee’s operations.

9.2 Obligation to Monitor for Hacks. Licensee shall take such measures as are reasonably necessary to determine the existence of Security Breaches or Territorial Breaches and shall promptly notify Licensor if any such occurrences are discovered.

9.3 Suspension Notice. Licensee shall notify Licensor immediately upon learning of the occurrence of any Security Breach or Territorial Breach, and shall provide Licensor with specific information describing the nature and extent of such occurrence. Licensor shall have the right to suspend the availability (“Suspension”) of its Included Programs on the Licensed Service at any time during the Term in the event of a Security Breach or Territorial Breach by delivering a written notice to the Licensee of such suspension (a “Suspension Notice”). Upon its receipt of a Suspension Notice, Licensee shall take steps immediately to remove the Included Programs or make the Included Programs inaccessible from the Licensed Service as soon as commercially feasible (but in no event more than three (3) calendar days after receipt of such notice).

9.4 Reinstatement/Termination. If the cause of the Security Breach that gave rise to a Suspension is corrected, repaired, solved or otherwise addressed in the sole, reasonable judgment of Licensor, the Suspension shall terminate upon written notice from Licensor and Licensor’s obligation to make its Included Programs available on the Licensed Service shall immediately resume. For clarity, no period of Suspension shall extend the Term in time, and upon a notice that a Suspension has ended, the Term shall end as otherwise provided in the Agreement unless earlier terminated in accordance with another provision of this Agreement. Upon receipt of such written notice, Licensee shall have the right to include the Included Programs on the Licensed Service as soon thereafter as practicable. If more than two (2) Suspensions occur during the Avail Term, or any single Suspension lasts for a period of three (3) months or more, Licensor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate this Agreement (“Security Breach Termination”) by providing written notice of such election to the Licensee.

protection and DRM standards no less stringent or robust than the standards attached hereto as Schedule C and incorporated herein by this reference.

Licensee shall not make, or authorize any others to make, any modifications, deletions, cuts, alterations or additions in or to any Included Program without the prior written consent of Licensor.

11.2 As between Licensee and Licensor, Licensee shall be responsible for clearing and making payments for music rights as necessary with respect to any distribution to the public of the Included Programs by Licensee in accordance with this Agreement, including all public performance/making available royalties, if any, payable to any organizations that are authorized to collect such royalties on behalf of rights holders in the applicable Territory (“Collecting Societies”) with respect to any musical compositions and/or sound recordings embodied in the Included Programs, where such clearances and payments arise solely from Licensee’s use of the Included Programs and to the extent the rights to collect such royalties are vested in and controlled by any Collecting Societies (“Collectively Administered Author’s Rights Payments”); and Licensor makes no representation or warranty with respect to such Collectively Administered Author’s Rights Payments.

13.5 The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement shall not result in the breach or non-performance of any agreements it has with any third party, provided that withdrawal of Included Programs in accordance with Section 6 of this Schedule A shall not constitute a breach of this section.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to provide such prompt notice shall diminish Licensor’s indemnification obligations only to the extent Licensor is actually prejudiced by such failure. In addition, Licensor shall not be required to indemnify Licensee or its Representatives for any claims resulting from Licensee exhibiting any Included Programs or using Advertising Materials in a form other than as delivered by Licensor, or due to Licensee’s editing or modification of any Included Programs or Advertising Materials, or due to Licensee’s authorization of a third party to do any of the foregoing.

15.2 Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless Licensor and its Representatives from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, arising out of or related to any third party claim resulting from (i) the breach by Licensee of any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement, (ii) the exhibition of any Advertising Materials created by Licensee pursuant to Paragraph 12.1 (other than material contained in Included Programs or Advertising Materials as delivered by Licensor and exhibited in strict accordance with this Agreement and Licensor’s instructions therefor), in connection with or relating, directly or indirectly, to such Included Programs or (iii) claims that technology owned by Licensee and used in connection with the Licensed Service infringes any right of any third party (including without limitation infringement upon or violation of a third party patent, copyright, trade name, trademark, source mark, trade secret of other intellectual property right by the Licensed Service), or violates any applicable law, other than as a result of the exhibition of the Included Programs in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement; *provided that* Licensor shall promptly notify Licensee of any such claim or litigation of which it becomes aware. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure to provide such prompt notice shall diminish Licensee’s indemnification obligations only to the extent Licensee is actually prejudiced by such failure. In addition, Licensee shall not be required to indemnify Licensor or its Representatives for any claims resulting from Licensee exhibiting any Included Programs or using Advertising Materials in the form as delivered by Licensor and in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

15.3 In any case in which indemnification is sought hereunder:

15.3.1	At the indemnifying party’s option, the indemnifying party may assume the handling,

settlement or defense of any such claim or litigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the handling, settlement or defense of any such claim or litigation, the party to be indemnified shall cooperate in the defense of such claim or litigation, and the indemnifying party’s obligation with respect to such claim or litigation shall be limited to holding the indemnified party harmless from any final judgment rendered on account of such claim or settlement made or approved by the indemnifying party in connection therewith, and expenses and reasonable attorneys fees of the indemnified party incurred in connection with the defense of such claim or litigation prior to the assumption thereof by the indemnifying party and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for performing such acts as the indemnifying party shall request. If the indemnifying party does not assume the handling, settlement or defense of any such claim or litigation, the indemnifying party shall, in addition to holding the indemnified party harmless from the amount of any damages awarded in any final judgment entered on account of such claim, reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable costs and expenses and reasonable attorneys fees of the indemnified party incurred in connection with the defense of any such claim or litigation; and

15.3.2   The party seeking indemnification shall fully cooperate with the reasonable requests of the other party in its participation in, and control of, any compromise, settlement, litigation or other resolution or disposition of any such claim. The indemnifying party shall not consent to the entry of any final judgment in any action without the indemnified party’s prior written approval except, in the case where Licensor is the indemnifying party, where such consent involves the agreement not to further exploit an Included Program.

**16. STATEMENTS; REPORTS**. Within sixty (60) days following the end of each calendar quarter of the Term, Licensee shall provide to Licensor and its designee, if any, a statement in electronic form (“Statement”) detailing the information specified by Licensor from time to time for the Licensed Service, including, without limitation:

(ii) total number of viewings of each Included Program in such month; the Actual Customers for such month;

**17. TERMINATION**.

17.1 Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement and subject to Section 17.3 of this Schedule, upon the occurrence of a Licensee Termination Event (as defined below), Licensor may, in addition to any and all other rights which it may have against Licensee, immediately terminate this Agreement or any license with respect to an Included Program by giving written notice to Licensee and/or, upon the occurrence of a Licensee Termination Event arising out of Licensee’s breach of Section 2.1, Schedule D or clauses (A)(y) or (B) of the definition of Licensee Event of Default, accelerate the payment of all monies payable under this Agreement such that they are payable immediately and to retain such monies, it being acknowledged that Licensee’s material obligations hereunder include full, non-refundable payment of 100% of the license fees described in this Agreement regardless of any early termination of this Agreement due to a Licensee Termination Event. Whether or not Licensor exercises such right of termination, Licensor shall, upon the occurrence of any Licensee Event of Default (as defined below), have no further obligation to deliver Included Programs or Advertising Materials to Licensee and Licensor shall have the right to require Licensee to immediately return all copies of Included Programs and Advertising Materials to Licensor.   In addition to any and all other remedies in respect of a Licensee Event of Default which Licensor may have under applicable law, Licensor shall be entitled to recover from Licensee all payments past due from Licensee to Licensor hereunder, together with interest, compounded monthly, at the lesser of (x) 110% of the Prime Rate and (y) the maximum rate permitted by law, plus reasonable attorneys fees, and all costs and expenses, including collection agency fees, incurred by Licensor to enforce the provisions thereof. Furthermore, upon a Licensee Event of Default, Licensor shall have the right to immediately suspend delivery of all Included Programs and materials with respect thereto and/or suspend Licensee’s right to exploit any Included Programs, licensed hereunder, without prejudice to any of its other rights hereunder. As used herein, a “Licensee Event of Default”: the occurrence of any of the following: (A) Licensee (x) fails to timely perform or breaches any of its material obligations hereunder or otherwise materially breaches this Agreement, (y) fails to make timely payment of fees under this Agreement or (z) assigns or otherwise transfers this Agreement in violation of this Agreement; or (B) upon (i) Licensee becoming unable to pay its debts; (ii) Licensee becoming insolvent; (iii) a petition under any bankruptcy or analogous act being filed by or against Licensee (which petition, if filed against Licensee, shall not have been dismissed by the relevant authority within thirty (30) days after Licensee’s knowledge thereof, it being agreed that service of process upon Licensee is deemed knowledge as of such date); (iv) Licensee executing an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (v) a receiver being appointed for the assets of Licensee; (vi) Licensee taking advantage of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or any other like statute; or (vii) the occurrence of any event analogous to the foregoing. As used herein a “Licensee Termination Event” shall mean (I) the occurrence of a curable Licensee Event of Default described in subclause

(A) above that Licensee has failed to cure within thirty (30) days written notice from Licensor of the occurrence of such default or, if such default is the failure to pay any installment or overage, within five (5) Business Days of notice from Licensor, (II) the occurrence of a non-curable Licensee Event of Default described in subclause (A) above and (III) the occurrence of a Licensee Event of Default described in subclause (B) above.

17.2 Subject to Section 17.3 of this Schedule, in the event Licensor materially defaults in the performance of any of its material obligations hereunder or Licensor becomes insolvent, or a petition under any bankruptcy act shall be filed by or against Licensor (which petition, if filed against Licensor, shall not have been dismissed within thirty (30) days thereafter), or Licensor executes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver is appointed for the assets of Licensor, or Licensor takes advantage of any applicable insolvency or reorganization or any other like statute (each of the above acts is hereinafter referred to as a “Licensor Event of Default”), and Licensor fails to cure such Licensor Event of Default within thirty (30) days after delivery by Licensee to Licensor of written notice of such Licensor Event of Default, then Licensee may, in addition to any and all other rights which it may have against Licensor, immediately terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Licensor.

17.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sections 17.1 or 17.2 hereof, no termination of this Agreement for any reason shall relieve or discharge, or be deemed or construed as relieving or discharging, any party hereto from any duty, obligation or liability hereunder which was accrued as of the date of such termination (including, without limitation, the obligation to pay any amounts payable hereunder accrued as of such date of termination).

**18.  Intentionally omitted.**

**19. ASSIGNMENT**. Licensee shall not assign, transfer or hypothecate its rights hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law (including, without limitation, by merger, consolidation or change in control), without Licensor’s prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may assign and transfer this Agreement without consent to any successor to all or substantially all of its assets or business, provided that Licensee shall provide written notice to Licensor of any such change of control and Licensor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice to Licensee if the successor-in-interest resulting from such change in control

(i) is a Qualifying Studio, Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, Nintendo, Panasonic, Samsung or an affiliate of the foregoing, or, in Licensor’s reasonable judgment, any other competitor of Licensor or its affiliates, 

(ii) is not, in Licensor’s reasonable business judgment, as creditworthy as Licensee or 

(iii) does not have capitalization or funding at least equal to or greater than that of Licensee immediately prior to the effective date of such change of control. In the event of such termination, Licensee shall pay to Licensor an amount equal to the aggregate of the Monthly Minimum Fees for the lesser of six (6) months following such termination and the remainder of the term of the Agreement (the “Accelerated Fee”). In the event that Licensor enters into a similar Internet-delivered SVOD license in the Territory with such successor-in-interest within twenty-four (24) months from the date of such termination, such Accelerated Fee will be credited against any future license fee payments with respect to such license.

**20. NON-WAIVER OF BREACH; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE**. A waiver by either party of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not, in any instance, be deemed or construed to be a waiver of such terms or conditions for the future or of any subsequent breach thereof. No payment or acceptance thereof pursuant to this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any provision hereof. All remedies, rights, undertakings, obligations and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be cumulative and none of them shall be in limitation of any other remedy, right, undertaking, obligation, or agreement of either party.

**21. GOVERNING LAW**. This Agreement shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the substantive laws (and not the law of conflicts) of the State of California and the United States of America with the same force and effect as if fully executed and to be fully performed therein. All actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof and/or the scope of the provisions of this Section 21 (a “Proceeding”) shall be submitted to JAMS (“JAMS”) for binding arbitration under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is over $250,000 or under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is $250,000 or less (as applicable, the “Rules”) to be held solely in Los Angeles, California, U.S.A., in the English language in accordance with the provisions below.

21.1 Each arbitration  shall be conducted by an arbitral tribunal (the “Arbitral Board”) consisting of a single arbitrator who shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge with at least ten (10) years experience in commercial matters. The Arbitral Board shall assess the cost, fees and expenses of the arbitration against the losing party, and the prevailing party in any arbitration or legal proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be entitled to all reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitral Board may require that such fees be borne in such other manner as the Arbitral Board determines is required in order for this arbitration clause to be enforceable under applicable law. The parties shall be entitled to conduct discovery in accordance with Section 1283.05 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, provided that (a) the Arbitral Board must authorize all such discovery in advance based on findings that the material sought is relevant to the issues in dispute and that the nature and scope of such discovery is reasonable under the circumstances, and (b) discovery shall be limited to depositions and production of documents unless the Arbitral Board finds that another method of discovery (e.g., interrogatories) is the most reasonable and cost efficient method of obtaining the information sought.

21.2 There shall be a record of the proceedings at the arbitration hearing and the Arbitral Board shall issue a Statement of Decision setting forth the factual and legal basis for the Arbitral Board's decision. If neither party gives written notice requesting an appeal within ten (10) business days after the issuance of the Statement of Decision, the Arbitral Board's decision shall be final and binding as to all matters of substance and procedure, and may be enforced by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of Licensee, such other court having jurisdiction over Licensee, which may be made *ex parte*, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.   If either party gives written notice requesting an appeal within ten (10) business days after the issuance of the Statement of Decision, the award of the Arbitral Board shall be appealed to three (3) neutral arbitrators (the **“**Appellate Arbitrators**”**), each of whom shall have the same qualifications and be selected through the same procedure as the Arbitral Board. The appealing party shall file its appellate brief within thirty (30) days after its written notice requesting the appeal and the other party shall file its brief within thirty (30) days thereafter. The Appellate Arbitrators shall thereupon review the decision of the Arbitral Board applying the same standards of review (and all of the same presumptions) as if the Appellate Arbitrators were a California Court of Appeal reviewing a judgment of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, except that the Appellate Arbitrators shall in all cases issue a final award and shall not remand the matter to the Arbitral Board. The decision of the Appellate Arbitrators shall be final and binding as to all matters of substance and procedure, and may be enforced by a petition to the Los Angeles County Superior Court or, in the case of Licensee, such other court having jurisdiction over Licensee, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award. The party appealing the decision of the Arbitral Board shall pay all costs and expenses of the appeal, including the fees of the Appellate Arbitrators and the reasonable outside attorneys' fees of the opposing party, unless the decision of the Arbitral Board is reversed, in which event the costs, fees and expenses of the appeal shall be borne as determined by the Appellate Arbitrators.

21.3 Subject to a party's right to appeal pursuant to the above, neither party shall challenge or resist any enforcement action taken by the party in whose favor the Arbitral Board, or if appealed, the Appellate Arbitrators, decided. Each party acknowledges that it is giving up the right to a trial by jury or court. The Arbitral Board shall have the power to enter temporary restraining orders and preliminary and permanent injunctions. Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the Arbitral Board’s award; *provided, however*, that prior to the appointment of the Arbitral Board or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek *pendente lite* relief in a court of competent jurisdiction in Los Angeles County, California or, if sought by Licensor, such other court that may have jurisdiction over Licensee, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this section. All arbitration proceedings (including proceedings before the Appellate Arbitrators) shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Licensee hereby irrevocably waives any right or remedy to seek and/or obtain injunctive or other equitable relief or any order with respect to, and/or to enjoin or restrain or otherwise impair in any manner, the production, distribution, exhibition or other exploitation of any motion picture, production or project related to Licensor, its parents, subsidiaries and affiliates, or the use, publication or dissemination of any advertising in connection with such motion picture, production or project. The provisions of this Section 21 shall supersede any inconsistent provisions of any prior agreement between the parties.

**22. NOTICES**. All notices hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sent by certified (return receipt requested) or registered mail, by air courier service, by personal delivery, or by facsimile to the address or fax number of the party for whom it is intended as follows, or to such other address or fax number as any party may hereafter specify in writing.

General. Notice given by personal delivery or facsimile shall be deemed given upon delivery and

notice given by overnight delivery or courier service shall be deemed given the first Business Day following the Business Day of delivery to the overnight delivery service.

**23. FORCE MAJEURE**. Neither party shall in any manner be liable or otherwise responsible for any delay or default in, or failure of performance resulting from or arising out of or in connection with any Event of Force Majeure, and no such delay, default in, or failure of performance shall constitute a breach by either party hereunder.

**24. CONFIDENTIALITY**. Other than as may be required by law, or governmental authority, or to enforce its rights hereunder, and subject to the following sentence, neither party shall, without the express written consent of the other, publicly divulge or announce, or in any manner disclose to any third party, other than its attorneys, advisors, directors, employees, agents, shareholders, accountants, parent entities or auditors, and, in the case of Licensor, its profit participants, or pursuant to Guild obligations (each of whom shall be subject to the confidentiality provision hereof) on a need-to-know basis, any of the specific terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the License Fees payable hereunder. Neither party shall issue any press release regarding the existence of or terms of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

**25. AUDIT**. Licensee shall keep and maintain complete and accurate books of account and records at its principal place of business in connection with each of the Included Programs and pertaining to Licensee’s compliance with the terms hereof, including, without limitation, copies of the statements referred to in Article 16 of this Schedule. Upon at least thirty (30) days’ written notice, and no more than once per calendar year, Licensor shall have the right during business hours to, either directly or through an independent audit firm of national (in the US and/or the Territory) standing unaffiliated with Licensee or Licensor, audit and check, at Licensor’s expense except as provided below, at Licensee’s principal place of business or a mutually-agreeable location designated by Licensee, Licensee’s books and records pertaining to the accuracy of the statements and other financial information delivered to Licensor by Licensee, and the amount of the license fees paid or payable hereunder, concerning the twelve (12) month period preceding Licensor’s notice of audit (including to the extent such notice is delivered after the expiration or termination date of this Agreement but within twelve (12) months of such date). Licensor agrees that the results of any such audit, and all information reviewed in connection therewith, will be deemed to constitute Licensee’s confidential information.   The exercise by Licensor of any right to audit or the acceptance by Licensor of any statement or payment, whether or not the subject of an audit, shall not bar Licensor from thereafter asserting a claim for any balance due, and Licensee shall remain fully liable for any balance due under the terms of this Agreement. If an examination establishes an error in Licensee’s computation of license fees due with respect to the Included Programs, Licensee shall immediately pay the amount of underpayment, plus interest thereon from the date such payment was originally due at a rate equal to the lesser of one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Prime Rate and the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.  If such error is in excess of five percent (5%) of such license fees due for the period covered by such audit, Licensee shall, in addition to making immediate payment of the additional license fees due plus interest in accordance with the previous sentence, pay to Licensor

`	`•	the reasonable, out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Licensor in connection with any such audit, and

`	`•	reasonable attorneys fees actually incurred by Licensor in enforcing the collection thereof. In the event that the rate of interest set forth in this Section exceeds the maximum permitted legal interest rate, such rate shall be automatically reduced to the maximum permitted legal interest rate, and all other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

**26. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**.

Except with respect to breaches of section 24 (Confidentiality),

indemnification payments owed to third parties, fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct, neither party shall be liable to the other for indirect, incidental, reliance, punitive, special, consequential or incidental damages.

**27. CAPTIONS/DRAFTING.**

Article, Section or other headings contained in this Agreement are for

convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In interpreting the terms and conditions of this Agreement, no presumption shall be interpreted for or against a party as a result of the role of such party or such party’s counsel in the drafting of this Agreement.

**28. CONFLICTING LAW OR REGULATION.** If any provision in this Agreement is determined by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable (for any reason, including, without limitation, in connection with “competition” legislation), such determination shall not affect any other provision, each of which shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were not contained herein.

**29. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.** This Agreement is entered into for the express benefit of the parties hereto, their successors and permitted assigns and is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to create in any other natural person, corporation, company, and/or any other entity whatsoever any rights or interest whatsoever, including, without limitation, any right to enforce the terms hereof.

**30. ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING**. This Agreement includes the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all prior agreements (written or oral) with respect to such subject matter have been merged herein. No representations or warranties have been made other than those expressly provided for herein. This Agreement may not be modified, except by a written instrument signed by the parties, and this provision may not be waived except by written instrument signed by the parties.

**31. FCPA**. It is the policy of Licensor to comply and require that its licensees comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 78dd-1 and 78dd-2, and all other applicable anti-corruption laws (collectively, "FCPA"). Licensee represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) Licensee is aware of the FCPA and will advise all persons and parties supervised by it of the requirements of the FCPA; (ii) Licensee has not and will not, and to its knowledge, no one acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action, directly or indirectly, in violation of the FCPA; (iii) Licensee has not in the last 5 years been accused of taking any action in violation of the FCPA; (iv) Licensee has not and will not cause any party to be in violation of the FCPA; (v) should Licensee learn of, or have reason to know of, any request for payment that is inconsistent with the FCPA, Licensee shall immediately notify Licensor; and (vi) Licensee is not a "foreign official" as defined under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, does not represent a foreign official, and will not share any fees or other benefits of this contract with a foreign official. Licensee will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensor and its Representatives for any and all liability arising from any violation of the FCPA caused or facilitated by Licensee. In the event Licensor deems that it has reasonable grounds to suspect Licensee has violated the FCPA, Licensor and its Representatives shall have the right to review and audit, at Licensor's expense, any and all books and financial records of Licensee at any time, and Licensor shall be entitled partially or totally to suspend its performance hereunder until such time it is proven to Licensor's satisfaction that Licensee has not violated the FCPA. In the event Licensor determines, in its sole discretion (whether through an audit or otherwise), that Licensee has violated the FCPA, either in connection with this Agreement or otherwise, Licensor may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Licensee. Such suspension or termination of this Agreement shall not subject Licensor to any liability, whether in contract or tort or otherwise, to Licensee or any third party, and Licensor's rights to indemnification or audit with respect to the FCPA shall survive such suspension or termination of this Agreement.
